<p>
  I have been giving private drum lessons since 2007, with a primary focus on rock drumming, rudiments, interdependence, and polyrhythms. My teaching practice is geared towards encouraging more women, non-binary, and queer people to tackle the drums. I’m excited to work with students of all backgrounds, genders, ability levels, ages, and interests.

<p>
  My rehearsal space is located in Berlin Neukölln, at Ziegrastrasse 11, near S-bahn Sonnenallee, and I am also willing to travel to students’ homes or studios.
</p>
<p>
  Lessons are always flexible and tailored to each student’s particular interests and learning habits.
