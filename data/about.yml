  text: "I’m a drummer, drum instructor, and session musician, born in Philadelphia and based in Berlin. With a passion for dynamics, groove, and delving into the drums as both a rhythmic and a melodic instrument, I can appreciate the beauty of a spacious 4/4 groove as much as I can enjoy digging into intricate, odd meters. I treasure the experience of working with other musicians to find the best flow and rhythmic hook to serve the song at hand."

  text: "I got started with drums when I enrolled in private lessons in rudiments and syncopation at the age of 10. At age 12 I found my home on the drum kit and became a student at the Paul Green School of Rock Music in Philadelphia. I spent the following four years there learning the ins and outs of rock music, training my ear, and performing and touring with other young musicians as well as seasoned professionals, such as Ike Willis (Frank Zappa), Adrien Belew (Yes), John Wetton (King Crimson), and Peter Frampton."
