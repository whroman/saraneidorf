- "I’m a drummer, drum instructor, and session musician, born in Philadelphia and based in Berlin. Beginning at age 10 with private lessons in rudiments, syncopation, and hand technique, I found my home on the drum kit at age 12, learning the ins and outs of rock music and ear-training at the Paul Green School of Rock Music in Philadelphia."
- "As a student at PGSORM from ages 12-16, I played live and toured with other young musicians as well as seasoned professionals, such as Ike Willis (Frank Zappa), Adrien Bellew (Yes), John Wetton (King Crimson), and Peter Frampton, among others. From 16-20, I studied under renowned jazz and rock drummer Allison Miller in Brooklyn. I began giving private drum lessons at the age of 17, and also taught drums at the Girls Rock Philly summer camp and after-school program (2012-2013, 2018), as well as several Berlin-based youth organizations geared towards girls’ empowerment, including Mädchencafe Schilleria and Mädchenzentrum Szenenwechsel. I am still happily working with private students in my studio in Berlin Neukölln."
- "I’ve been collaborating, gigging, and recording with original bands in Philadelphia (e.g. Sarattma, The Bad Vibes, Scythe of Azrael) and Berlin. From 2012 to the present day, I’ve worked with the following Berlin-based projects: Mellowdeath, I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream, Godmother, Attention Horse, Mad Kate & The Tide, Valerie Renay, Choral Hearse, Aptera, Madrigal, and The Brian Jonestown Massacre. Most recently, I completed a five-week European tour with the Brian Jonestown Massacre and recorded drums on their self-titled album (release date: March 15, 2019)."
- "Alongside my work as a drummer, I am also a programmer of queer, feminist, and horror cinema. To find out more about my work as a film curator go to finalgirlsberlin.com."
